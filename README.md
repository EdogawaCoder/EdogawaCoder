## Edison Araújo | Full-Stack Developer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Edison (Edo), a dedicated software developer from Brazil, focused on building clean, reliable, and scalable applications.

I work with **Java / Spring Boot** for backend development and I'm advancing in **React** for modern frontend applications.  
I also work with **SQL databases** (PostgreSQL) and apply best practices in architecture, REST APIs, exception handling, authentication (JWT), and Docker.

I value clarity, continuous learning, and high-quality code designed to solve real business problems.
